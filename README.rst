========

db2utils is a collection of utility routines for `IBM DB2 for
Linux/UNIX/Windows`_ (DB2 for LUW) which I have developed over several years as
a DBA to make my duties a little easier. The package has been tested on DB2
9.7, 10.1, and 10.5 under Linux (and previously with DB2 9.5 under Linux,
although I cannot currently test with this version).

The projcet uses the `MIT license`_. `Source code`_ and `downloads`_ are
available on GitHub.  Extensive `documentation`_ is available from ReadTheDocs,
which includes installation instructions.
