                                  Installation

Linux

   Log on as a user which has SYSADM authority for the DB2 instance you wish to
   install under (commonly this is db2inst1), and ensure the db2profile for the
   target DB2 instance has been sourced (this is the usually the case with the
   db2inst1 user):

 $ su - db2inst1
 $ source ~db2inst1/sqllib/db2profile

   Extract the archive you downloaded, and change to the directory it creates:

 $ tar -xzf db2utils-0.1.tar.gz
 $ cd db2utils

   Edit the two variables DBNAME and SCHEMANAME at the top of the Makefile:

 $ ${EDITOR} Makefile

   These indicate the database into which to install everything and the schema
   under which to place all objects. Finally, use the included Makefile to make
   the "install" target:

 $ make install

   This will compile the external pcre UDFs library, install it in the instance
   identified by the DB2INSTANCE environment variable (which is set by
   db2profile), then connect to the database identified by DBNAME and install
   everything under the schema specified by SCHEMANAME.

   If you wish to see the SQL that would be executed without actually executing
   it (if, for example, you wish to edit it before hand) you can create it with
   the following target:

 $ make install.sql

   If you wish to uninstall everything from the database, simply make the
   "uninstall" target:

 $ make uninstall

   There is also a target which attempts to test the implementation of various
   functions by running a query and comparing the output to an expected value.
   This can be run with the "test" target:

 $ make test

   The tests that are executed and the expected results are in the test.dat
   file. The test.awk script is used to convert this into an enormous SQL
   query.

Windows

   Anyone want to figure this out?
